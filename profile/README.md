# Telegram Web Apps

Community of developers which are excited to create new applications on Telegram
Web Apps platform.

The main our goal is to create useful, simple and intuitive functionality which
will be comfortable to use while developing Web Apps applications. Additionally,
to make platform research better, we provide documentation for all Web Apps
components with examples. So, deep dive into Web Apps becomes really easy.

## Quick start

To start learning, how Web Apps works, look into our
[documentation repository](https://github.com/Telegram-Web-Apps/documentation).
It explains, what this platform is, how it could be used, which components you
need etc.

## Projects

### [client-sdk](https://github.com/Telegram-Web-Apps/client-sdk)

TypeScript reimplemented Source Development Kit for Telegram Web Apps client
application. Fully independent and made from scratch. Recommended to use 
instead of officially provided library (see [this link](https://github.com/Telegram-Web-Apps/client-sdk#motivation) why).

### [init-data-ts](https://github.com/Telegram-Web-Apps/init-data-ts)

TypeScript isomorphic library to make work with Telegram Web Apps init data
easier. This library includes functions to verify and parse init data
sent from client side of application. Used by [client-sdk](https://github.com/Telegram-Web-Apps/client-sdk).

### [init-data-golang](https://github.com/Telegram-Web-Apps/init-data-golang)

This library is the same as [init-data-ts](https://github.com/Telegram-Web-Apps/init-data-ts),
but made with Golang.

## Contribution
