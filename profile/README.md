# Telegram Mini Apps

This GitHub organization aims at improving the developer experience for the Telegram Mini Apps platform. 
It provides complete documentation, templates, and a wide range of packages for various programming languages.

## Motivation

### Single source

One of the purposes of this organization is to provide a single source of information for the platform, 
significantly decreasing the barrier for entry. Telegram's documentation can sometimes be difficult to 
research and find the specific information that developers need. This is the reason why community needs
this kind of organization.

### Public development

The other idea behind the organization is to make platform development public. Developers would like to
see what is going on behind the scenes or at least know what is going to be implemented in near future.
This is rather rare feature for big companies, but we believe that Telegram is able to help with this.

Everything provided by the organization is the result of hard work and is available for free to everyone.

## Design

### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/@firststagelabs)

Design component library in Figma, which will make it easier for designers to design apps for Telegram 
Mini Apps. The components fully mimic the Telegram interface, use it as a foundation, and inherit all 
existing principles. Libraries are available for iOS and Android. Moreover, these same components are 
reused for designing the [@wallet](https://walletbot.org/). Please note that the libraries are in beta
status, so bugs are possible.
