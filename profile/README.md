# Telegram Mini Apps

This GitHub organisation was created by a single developer which is excited to improve such
Telegram platform as Telegram Mini Apps. All packages, documentations and examples are also maintained
by a single developer.

To understand the platform concepts, you could probably begin with the [documentation](https://docs.twa.dev/docs/introduction/about-platform).

To start developing applications on the platform, take a look at [@tma.js monorepo](https://github.com/Telegram-Mini-Apps/tma.js).
