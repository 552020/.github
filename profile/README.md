# Telegram Mini Apps

This GitHub organization was created by a single developer which is excited to improve such
Telegram platform as Telegram Mini Apps. All packages, documentations and examples are also maintained
by a single developer. At the moment, organization mostly aims at **TypeScript**, **Node** and **GoLang**.

## Motivation

### Single source

The main purpose of this organization is to provide a single source of information for the platform, 
significantly decreasing the barrier for entry. Telegram's documentation can sometimes be difficult to 
research and find the specific information that developers need. That's why the author of this organization
spent more than a year researching the creation of Telegram, its concepts, ideas, and problems.

### Public development

The other idea behind the organization is to make platform development public. Developers would like to
see what is going on behind the scenes or at least know what is going to be implemented in near future.
This is rather rare feature for big companies, but I believe that Telegram is able to help with this.

Everything provided by the organization is the result of hard work and is available for free to everyone.
